## Assignment 4 ##
	
	### Initialization of Parameters (W,b) ###
	   1. Zero initialization of parameters results in poor train accuracy of 50%
	   2. Random Initialization of parameters result in accuracy of 83%
	   3. He Initalization of parameters result in train accuracy of 99%
       ### L2 regularization and Drop out ###
            1. These are techniques which helps to remove/mitigate overfitting of training data
