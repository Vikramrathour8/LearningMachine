2. Implementing 5-Layer Neural Network to predict cat with accuracy of 80%

## Assignment 4 ##
 	
### Initialization of Parameters (W,b) ###

1. Zero initialization of parameters results in poor train accuracy of 50%
2. Random Initialization of parameters result in accuracy of 83%
3. He Initalization of parameters result in train accuracy of 99%
	
### L2 regularization and Drop out ###

1. These are techniques which helps to remove/mitigate overfitting of training data

## SoftMax Regression for Number classification Using Tensorflow ##
	
Using 3 hidden layers along with L2 regularization and Adam Optimizer to predict number with accuracy of 80% and have training accuracy of 99.08%
     
     
## MNIST using TensorFlow ##
 
Designed for any number of hidden layers. It has train accuracy of 99.41 % and test accuracy of about 97.51 % provided number of hidden layers are 3 and hidden units are 500,300 respectively
